My initial adventure into CNC machining at the local Makerspace.
At this point I can just spell CNC, beyond  that its all foreign. This is
work in progress that will hopefully one day make it in some form to
the Makerspace Wiki.

Intro:

TheLab makerspace CNC machine is the Shapeoko Pro XXL.

Shapeoko Pro XXL guide:  https://my.carbide3d.com/gettingstarted/shapeokopro/

Carbide3d, the company behind the Shapeoko, makes a design software package called Carbide Create. The TheLab does not currently have a license for using a full version of Carbide Create for project design. The Carbide3D's “Carbide Motion” software product is the tool which is used to actually execute/run the G-code on the Shapeoko.  

 For project design and G-Code generation the software used in TheLab is the Vectric Vcarve Pro Makerspace edition. There are two version of this Vcarve Pro Makerspace edition.

 Versions of Vectric Vcarve Pro Makerspace
 
    • Master License: The TheLab has a Makerspace master license for Vectric Vcarve Pro. This version is a limited full license version which means in addition to being used to design projects it will also generate the required G-Code to be downloaded to the Shapeoko CNC machine. While it is a full version it supports a limited number of users.
        ◦ This version is installed on one or 2 of the lab computers.
          
    • Maker License: Vectric has made available a free version of Vcarve Pro for Makerspace members to use on their own personal computers. This is a fully capable “design only” version. This means one cannot generate the required G-Code for the CNC machine.
       The idea is to design you project at home, save it to  file, load that file on the lab machine that does have the fully capable version and generate the G-Code with that full version.
        ◦ For member access to this home “free” version you must be invited by a Makerspace CNC area coordinator. They will send you an invite email which you can use to access the Makerspace version. You cannot get this version directly from the Vectric Vcarve site, you must use the invite.
        ◦ One installed this version will show “Trial” in the upper left to the right of the product name until you load a file.
