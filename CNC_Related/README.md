My initial adventure into CNC machining at the local Makerspace. At this point I can just spell CNC, beyond  that its all foreign.

This is work in progress that will hopefully one day make it in some form to
the Makerspace Wiki.

# **Introduction:**

## The machine
TheLab makerspace CNC machine is the **Shapeoko Pro XXL**.

Shapeoko Pro XXL guide:  https://my.carbide3d.com/gettingstarted/shapeokopro/

Carbide3d, the company behind the Shapeoko, makes a design software package called Carbide Create. The TheLab does not currently have a license for using a full version of Carbide Create for project design.

- The Carbide3D's **Carbide Motion** software product is the tool which is used to actually execute/run the G-code on the Shapeoko.

## Design Your Project

- Most CNC design software that will produce the G-Code required by the machine driving software used in TheLab can be used to design your CNC project. Whatever you chose, design your project, generate the G-Code and load that into the machine software.
- For project design and G-Code generation the software used in TheLab is the **Vectric Vcarve Pro** Makerspace edition. There are two version of this Vcarve Pro Makerspace edition.
