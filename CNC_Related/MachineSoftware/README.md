This is work in progress that will hopefully one day make it in some form to
the Makerspace Wiki.

# **Introduction:**

## The machine
TheLab makerspace CNC machine is the **Shapeoko Pro XXL**.

Shapeoko Pro XXL guide:  https://my.carbide3d.com/gettingstarted/shapeokopro/

Carbide3d, the company behind the Shapeoko, makes a design software package called Carbide Create. The TheLab does not currently have a license for using a full version of Carbide Create for project design.

- The Carbide3D's **Carbide Motion** software product is the tool which is used to actually execute/run the G-code on the Shapeoko.  

## Design Your Project

- For project design and G-Code generation the software used in TheLab is the **Vectric Vcarve Pro** Makerspace edition. There are two version of this Vcarve Pro Makerspace edition. Details for the design portion of your project can be found in another sub section of this wiki page.
