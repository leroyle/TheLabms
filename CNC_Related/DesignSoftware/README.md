## Design Your Project

- Most CNC design software that will produce the G-Code required by the machine driving software used in TheLab can be used to design your CNC project. Whatever you chose, design your project, generate the G-Code and load that into the machine software.

- For project design and G-Code generation the software generally used in TheLab is the **Vectric Vcarve Pro** Makerspace edition, so that will be our focus here. There are two version of this Vcarve Pro Makerspace edition.

 
### Master License:
The TheLab has a Makerspace master license for Vectric Vcarve Pro. This version is a limited full license version which means in addition to being used to design projects it will also generate the required G-Code to be downloaded to the Shapeoko CNC machine. While it is a full version it supports a limited number of users.

This version is installed on one or 2 of the lab computers.
          
### Maker License:
Vectric has made available a free version of Vcarve Pro for Makerspace members to use on their own personal computers. This is a fully capable “design only” version. This means one cannot generate the required G-Code for the CNC machine.

- **For member access to this home “free” version you must be invited by a Makerspace CNC area coordinator. They will send you an invite email which you can use to access the Makerspace version. You cannot get this version directly from the Vectric Vcarve site, you must use the invite.**

Once installed this version will show “Trial” in the upper left to the right of the product name until you load a file. *we believe this "Trial" version does not expire, though we could be wrong.*

### Project Creation Steps
  - The idea is to design you project at home, save the project to a file,
  - load that project file on the lab machine that does have the fully capable version of Vetric Vcarve Pro. With this version generate and save to a file the G-Code for the design.
  - Once the G-Code is created and saved to a file, it is sent/taken to the Carbide 3D Motion software which will actually drive the machine
