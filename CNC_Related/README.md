An initial adventure into CNC machining at the local Makerspace.

At this point some of us can just about spell CNC, beyond that its all foreign. The information provided should be considered general in nature. At the moment it may be a bit scattered and incomplete in certain areas.

Feel free to shoot a note on the Discord, CNC channel with suggestions/updates.

This is work in progress that will hopefully one day make it in some form to
the Makerspace Wiki.

# **Introduction:**

## The machine
TheLab makerspace CNC machine is the **Shapeoko Pro XXL**.

Shapeoko Pro XXL guide:  https://my.carbide3d.com/gettingstarted/shapeokopro/

Carbide3d, the company behind the Shapeoko, makes a design software package called Carbide Create. The TheLab does not currently have a license for using a full version of Carbide Create for project design.

- The Carbide3D's **Carbide Motion** software product is the tool which is used to actually execute/run the G-code on the Shapeoko.

## Design Your Project

- Most CNC design software that will produce the G-Code required by the machine driving software used in TheLab can be used to design your CNC project. Whatever you chose, design your project, generate the G-Code and load that into the machine software.
- For project design and G-Code generation the software used in TheLab is the **Vectric Vcarve Pro** Makerspace edition. There are two version of this Vcarve Pro Makerspace edition.
